Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects.  <p>In its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms.  The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication.  New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included.  Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage.  <p>As in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers.  Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds.  <p> Each chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic.  The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs.  Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning.</p></p></p>\n  "]} {:tag :authors, :attrs nil, :content [{:tag :author, :attrs nil, :content [{:tag :id, :attrs nil, :content ["60841"]} {:tag :name, :attrs nil, :content ["Thomas H.

With plenty of advice from an indisputable expert in the field,  this title is sure to be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants  to get more out of their code.<p>As a veteran developer at Sun, the  author shares his considerable insight into the design choices made  over the years in Sun's own Java libraries (which the author  acknowledges haven't always been perfect). Based on his experience  working with Sun's best minds, the author provides a compilation of 57  tips for better Java code organized by category. Many of these ideas  will let you write more robust classes that better cooperate with  built-in Java APIs. Many of the tips make use of software patterns and  demonstrate an up-to-the-minute sense of what works best in today's  design. Each tip is clearly introduced and explained with code snippets  used to demonstrate each programming principle.<p>Early sections on  creating and destroying objects show you ways to make better use of  resources, including how to avoid duplicate objects. Next comes an  absolutely indispensable guide to implementing &quot;required&quot; methods for  custom classes. This material will help you write new classes that  cooperate with old ones (with advice on implementing essential  requirements like the <em>equals()</em> and <em>hashCode()</em>  methods).<p>The author has a lot to say about class design, whether  using inheritance or composition. Tips on designing methods show you  how to create understandable, maintainable, and robust classes that can  be easily reused by others on your team. Sections on mapping C code  (like structures, unions, and enumerated types) onto Java will help C  programmers bring their existing skills to Sun's new language. Later  sections delve into some general programming tips, like using  exceptions effectively. The book closes with advice on using threads  and synchronization techniques, plus some worthwhile advice on object  serialization.<p>Whatever your level of Java knowledge, this title can  make you a more effective programmer. Wisely written, yet never pompous  or doctrinaire, the author has succeeded in packaging some really  valuable nuggets of advice into a concise and very accessible guidebook  that arguably deserves a place on most any developer's bookshelf.  <em>--Richard Dragan</em> <p> <strong>Topics covered:</strong> &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Best practices and tips for Java &lt;li&gt;Creating and destroying objects (static factory methods,  singletons, avoiding duplicate objects and finalizers) &lt;li&gt;Required methods for custom classes (overriding <em>equals()</em>,  <em>hashCode()</em>, <em>toString()</em>, <em>clone()</em>, and  <em>compareTo()</em> properly) &lt;li&gt;Hints for class and interface design (minimizing class and member  accessibility, immutability, composition versus inheritance, interfaces  versus abstract classes, preventing subclassing, static versus  nonstatic classes) &lt;li&gt;C constructs in Java (structures, unions, enumerated types, and  function pointers in Java) &lt;li&gt;Tips for designing methods (parameter validation, defensive copies,  method signatures, method overloading, zero-length arrays, hints for  Javadoc comments) &lt;li&gt;General programming advice (local variable scope, using Java API  libraries, avoiding <em>float</em> and <em>double</em> for exact  comparisons, when to avoid strings, string concatenation, interfaces  and reflection, avoid native methods, optimizing hints, naming  conventions) &lt;li&gt;Programming with exceptions (checked versus run-time exceptions,  standard exceptions, documenting exceptions, failure-capture  information, failure atomicity) &lt;li&gt;Threading and multitasking (synchronization and scheduling hints,  thread safety, avoiding thread groups) &lt;li&gt;Serialization (when to implement <em>Serializable</em>, the  <em>readObject()</em>, and <em>readResolve()</em> methods) </p></p></p></p></p>\n  "]} {:tag :authors, :attrs nil, :content [{:tag :author, :attrs nil, :content [{:tag :id, :attrs nil, :content ["60805"]} {:tag :name, :attrs nil, :content ["Joshua Bloch"]} {:tag :image_url, :attrs nil, :content ["http://www.goodreads.com/images/nophoto/nophoto-U-200x266.jpg"]} {:tag :small_image_url, :attrs nil, :content ["http://www.goodreads.com/images/nophoto/nophoto-U-50x66.jpg"]} {:tag :link, :attrs nil, :content ["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60805.Joshua_Bloch"]} {:tag :average_rating, :attrs nil, :content ["4.38"]} {:tag :ratings_count, :attrs nil, :content ["249"]} {:tag :text_reviews_count, :attrs nil, :content ["52"]}]}]} {:tag :published, :attrs nil, :content ["2001"]}]} {:tag :rating, :attrs nil, :content ["4"]} {:tag :votes, :attrs nil, :content ["0"]} {:tag :spoiler_flag, :attrs nil, :content ["false"]} {:tag :shelves, :attrs nil, :content [{:tag :shelf, :attrs {:name "read"}, :content nil} {:tag :shelf, :attrs {:name "highly-recommended"}, :content nil}]} {:tag :recommended_for, :attrs nil, :content nil} {:tag :recommended_by, :attrs nil, :content nil} {:tag :started_at, :attrs nil, :content ["Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2007"]} {:tag :read_at, :attrs nil, :content nil} {:tag :date_added, :attrs nil, :content ["Thu Jul 08 20:44:14 -0700 2010"]} {:tag :date_updated, :attrs nil, :content ["Fri Jul 09 14:08:49 -0700 2010"]} {:tag :read_count, :attrs nil, :content nil} {:tag :body, :attrs nil, :content ["If you program Java, you must read this book.
