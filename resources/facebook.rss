      <title>John I did some &quot;networking&quot; tonight. Was it an A+? No. B? No. Riding that fine line between C- and D+? Yes! And that is wildly better than my typical efforts, which generally involve a wooden bridge, a can of gasoline, and a match.</title>

      <title>John SVN statistics show that Thursdays are my most productive day. Unfortunately, I have been wasting all day working on a grant we will not get. Oh well. :(.</title>

      <title>John Just over heard that we didn&apos;t get any of the grants we applied for. That is a punch in the face. I should maybe start looking for a new job.</title>
