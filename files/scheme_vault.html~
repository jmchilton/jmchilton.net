<title>John's Scheme Vault</title>

<p> So you want access to John's famous scheme vault? HA! You
wish. John's scheme vault is in a very secure location and you will
never be granted access. It protected by three 50+ character
passpharses and custom 16 kilobit encryption. The laptop that the
scheme vault is stored on is not connected to any network and is
specially equiped with very percise sensors that will trigger the
physical destruction of the laptop's hard drive and memory if the
laptop's case is breached. It is in a room protected with lasers and
dogs, and once gaurded by dogs with lasers (may they rest in
peace). We are not talking about the lasers from the movies either.
They are not just sparse enough to allow humans to pass through
them. They are really dense.</p> </body> </html>
